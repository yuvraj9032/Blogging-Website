        <h4>To better spend your time, start by understanding where your time is spent. There are great time management apps out there to track time, but in all honesty, I prefer to keep it lightweight—Marc Andreessen's notecard system has always worked for me.</h4>

The internet and social media have sped up how you get your news, how you stay in contact with people, and how you communicate with your customers. It has also caused all of us to create some bad habits—one of which is multitasking.</h4>
